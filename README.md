#  Weather Stations

This is a simple app that connects to the [National Weather Service's API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/) to grab the available station information that it has. It then displays minimal information of each station.

The intent of this project is to show how various components can be properly unit tested.

I plan to also show how fastlane can be used to build the application, run tests, and archive an application. But that is forthcoming.
